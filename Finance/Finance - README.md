# Melvin-Python-Project

During my undergraduate programme, I completed a programming course where I developed a project to determine the impact of interest rates on key investments such as gold and shares. This project involved using Python to analyse historical data and uncover interesting relationships that are not traditionally taught in a finance class.

This valuation function file is a continuation of my previous project, which aimed to analyse the impact of interest rates on key investments like gold and shares. In this follow-up project, I developed a valuation function that can estimate the value of a portfolio based on a given change in interest rates. By using this tool, investors can gain insights into the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations on their investment portfolios.
